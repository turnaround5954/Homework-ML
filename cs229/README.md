# My solutions to cs229 problem sets

I removed some duplicate stuff where I've done in cs231n or other courses (and something I'm too lazy to do): <br>
 1. I didn't implement KMeans in ps3.
 2. I didn't implement NN in ps4. Instead, I implemented RL (cartpole).

What a pity! I didn't learn how to use LaTex, so answers to writing questions are not here.
